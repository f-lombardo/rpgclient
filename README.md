# Sample RPG Kotlin client project
Sample Kotlin project using [smeup-rpg](https://github.com/smeup/smeup-rpg) 

This project was initially created with ```gradle init```

After cloning the project, run
```
./gradlew idea
```
Then run the tests:
```
./gradlew test
```
You are now ready to import the gradle project into IDEA. We suggest to flag the *"Automatically import this project on changes in build script files"* option in gradle settings.
